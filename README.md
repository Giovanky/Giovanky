# Hi!

## Hi my name is Giovanny, I'm from Chile & I'm software developer

- I am currently working with html, css and javascript thoroughly worrying about having the best possible performance

- Following the javascript path I am also working with node js making api

- This year I graduated from university, so there is still a lot to learn

## If you want to see some cool projects that I have in my git, here are some!

### Natours
####  In this project simulate a grid system like css grid, and implement the functionality of a pwa to be able to install it on the phone, with a small cache system to work offline

### Firefox Developer Edition
#### This project is about cloning the landing page of firefox developer edition, in which I use scss from start to finish, it is not fully responsive yet but I hope to fix it these days as I check my repositories!

### Pokeapp project
#### This project is the most fullstack and serious that I am currently doing, it is about a pokedex, supported by several libraries, I could use an external api to obtain the pokemon, but I elaborate my own!, I will soon be adding test, docker and who knows what more will need!

#### Without more to add I leave you my email for what you need, keep coding!
